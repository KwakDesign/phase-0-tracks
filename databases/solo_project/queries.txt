1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
input:
SELECT * FROM nba_players;

output:
1|Steph Curry|30|1
2|Kevin Durant|35|1
3|Lebron James|23|2
4|Kevin Love|0|2

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
input:
INSERT INTO nba_players (player_name, player_num, team_id) VALUES ("Kyrie Irving", 2, 2);

output:
1|Steph Curry|30|1
2|Kevin Durant|35|1
3|Lebron James|23|2
4|Kevin Love|0|2
5|Kyrie Irving|2|2

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
input:
SELECT * FROM nba_players, nba_teams WHERE nba_players.team_id = nba_teams.id;

output:
1|Steph Curry|30|1|1|Golden State Warriors|true
2|Kevin Durant|35|1|1|Golden State Warriors|true
3|Lebron James|23|2|2|Cleveland Cavaliers|true
4|Kevin Love|0|2|2|Cleveland Cavaliers|true
5|Kyrie Irving|2|2|2|Cleveland Cavaliers|true

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
input:
SELECT nba_players.player_name, nba_teams.team_name FROM nba_players JOIN nba_teams ON nba_players.team_id = nba_teams.id;

output:
Steph Curry|Golden State Warriors
Kevin Durant|Golden State Warriors
Lebron James|Cleveland Cavaliers
Kevin Love|Cleveland Cavaliers
Kyrie Irving|Cleveland Cavaliers

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
input:
DELETE FROM nba_players WHERE player_name="Kyrie Irving";

output:
1|Steph Curry|30|1
2|Kevin Durant|35|1
3|Lebron James|23|2
4|Kevin Love|0|2

CROSS JOIN:
input:
SELECT player_name, player_num, team_name, won_champ FROM nba_teams CROSS JOIN nba_players;

output:
Steph Curry|30|Golden State Warriors|true
Kevin Durant|35|Golden State Warriors|true
Lebron James|23|Golden State Warriors|true
Kevin Love|0|Golden State Warriors|true
Steph Curry|30|Cleveland Cavaliers|true
Kevin Durant|35|Cleveland Cavaliers|true
Lebron James|23|Cleveland Cavaliers|true
Kevin Love|0|Cleveland Cavaliers|true

INNER JOIN:
input:
SELECT player_name, player_num, team_name, won_champ FROM nba_players INNER JOIN nba_teams ON nba_players.team_id = nba_teams.id;

output:
Steph Curry|30|Golden State Warriors|true
Kevin Durant|35|Golden State Warriors|true
Lebron James|23|Cleveland Cavaliers|true
Kevin Love|0|Cleveland Cavaliers|true

OUTER JOIN:
*With the way the current database is built the input and output will be the same as the INNER JOIN, as a matter of fact OUTER JOIN is an extension of INNER JOIN. The OUTER JOIN's condition is identical to INNER JOIN's condition.
