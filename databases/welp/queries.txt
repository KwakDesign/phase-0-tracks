1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
input:
SELECT *
FROM REVIEWS
JOIN USERS ON USERS.id = REVIEWS.user_id
JOIN BUSINESSES ON BUSINESSES.id = REVIEWS.business_id;

output:
1|4|good art!|2|5|5|Spike|Spiegel|2|Jon's Art Shop

2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
input:
SELECT first_name, last_name, business_name, review_stars, comment
FROM USERS
JOIN REVIEWS ON REVIEWS.user_id = USERS.id
JOIN BUSINESSES ON BUSINESSES.id = REVIEWS.business_id;

output:
Spike|Spiegel|Jon's Art Shop|4|Expensive but worth the price.
Homer|Simpson|Bill's BBQ Pit|5|Great BBQ!
Rick|Sanchez|Dani's BJJ Dojo|5|Sensei Dani is tough!!

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
input:
SELECT first_name, last_name, business_name, review_stars, comment
FROM USERS
JOIN REVIEWS ON REVIEWS.user_id = USERS.id
JOIN BUSINESSES ON BUSINESSES.id = REVIEWS.business_id
WHERE business_name="Bill's BBQ Pit";

output:
Homer|Simpson|Bill's BBQ Pit|5|Great BBQ!
