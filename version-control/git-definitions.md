# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that allows us to track progress, review and revert changes, create backups in our code and merge revisions made by multiple people.
It's useful because it gives us the ability to reverse any changes that were made in case of an error, see who made the changes, and it's key to coordinating a group of contributors on a single project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the project you are working on. It allows you to experiment and work freely without it affecting the original project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit creates a save point in the project you work on. A good commit message is meaningful and contextual.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa. A merge conflict can happen when you merge or pull from a branch.
