# jQuery

My plan to tackle jQuery in 2 hours is going to based on working of off jquery.com which features a jQuery basics section that goes over the fundamentals and has you immediately practicing using jQuery and browsing over w3schools.com jQuery section which has great practice sections and simplified explanations of jQuery.

I will do my best in utilizing and time boxing my learning and focus on covering portions of jQuery I believe are suited to give me a well rounded understanding of jQuery in general. I chose this route over a video tutorial as I feel those experiences tend to be a bit more linear and won't let you jump around to sections that might peak my interest.

While studying I will make sure to take quick breaks periodically so I won't feel overwhelmed.
